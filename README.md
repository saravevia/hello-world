A bit about me...

I'm a schooled science and business gal, with a strong leadership background in healthcare, and presently learning IT. 

I'm beginning my journey learning new cool, exciting coding.  These are really fun times.  I have been working in the Microsoft BI stack for some time and learned SQL along the way.  It's been fun working with a team of people from all different backgrounds and experience levels learning together.  At this point, finding a couple mentors would be a really good idea, but where in the world are they in IT?
